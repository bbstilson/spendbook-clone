- don't let a post of $0
- test this on a mobile device for realzies
- login.jsx and signup.jsx could probably be the same component...
- more complete error handling for everything
- TESTING (jest/enzyme)
- refactor/rethink the redux stores. they're all weird right now...
- add indications of a post submitting. like imessage sending a text or something. that style
